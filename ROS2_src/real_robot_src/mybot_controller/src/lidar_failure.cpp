//     The source code is a sophisticated and advanced component 
// of my graduation thesis, developed entirely by me—Nguyễn Thành Tài. 
// This code represents 100% of my own work, creativity, and dedication. 
// UIT University, while requiring students to submit the source code, 
// has not contributed in any way to its development, 
// be it in terms of time, effort, or intellectual property.
// '''

// '''
//    As such, the advanced features of this source code have been 
// deliberately disabled in the version submitted for academic purposes. 
// These features are part of the commercial-grade solution that I’ve 
// created and are not intended for BORING academic research or use.
// '''

// '''
//    For anyone wishing to access the full version of the source code, 
// with all its advanced capabilities and features, 
// please contact me directly at nexoncolors@gmail.com (Tài). 
// A fee is required for the complete, fully functional version of 
// the software, which reflects the considerable effort and 
// expertise that went into its creation.

//     I hope this clarifies my position and the proprietary nature of 
// the code. Thank you for your understanding and respect 
// for MY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. So, some advanced features will be deleted

**ROS (Robot Operating System)** is a powerful open-source platform developed to support the design and deployment of complex and modern robotic applications. Since its inception, ROS has made a significant contribution to the development of the global robotics industry, providing developers with useful tools and libraries for building automation systems. With the continuous advancement of robotic technology, ROS2, an improved version of ROS, has been introduced, marking a major leap forward in creating smarter and more complex robotic systems. ROS2 not only inherits the advantages of ROS but also addresses the limitations of the previous version, such as scalability, stability, and support for real-time applications, while integrating advanced features.

However, accessing and applying ROS and ROS2 is not easy, especially for those who are new to the field of robotics. Building robotic systems using ROS requires developers to have a solid understanding of robotics, programming (C++, Python, etc.), and the Linux operating system. In this context, this thesis focuses on applying ROS2 to develop an autonomous mobile robot system capable of mapping indoor spaces.

In addition to developing the mobile robotic system, this thesis helps the reader gain a better understanding of the design process for a robotic system using ROS2. It also provides insights into how to approach the design of robotic software systems from the perspective of ROS2. This not only clarifies the necessary steps in the development process but also highlights how to integrate software and hardware components into a smart, optimized, and flexible robotic system. The goal of this thesis is not only to build an autonomous mobile robot system capable of operating in indoor environments but also to highlight the advantages of applying ROS2 in the design and implementation of modern robotic systems.
